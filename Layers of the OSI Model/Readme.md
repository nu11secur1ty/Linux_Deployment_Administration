# Who Developed the OSI Model?
The International Standards Organization (ISO) developed the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. 
It divides network communication into seven layers. In this model, layers 1-4 are considered the lower layers, and mostly concern themselves with moving data around. Layers 5-7, called the the upper layers, contain application-level data. Networks operate on one basic principle: "pass it on." Each layer takes care of a very specific job, and then passes the data onto the next layer.

- The 7 Layers of the OSI
In the OSI model, control is passed from one layer to the next, starting at the application layer (Layer 7) in one station, and proceeding to the bottom layer, over the channel to the next station and back up the hierarchy. The OSI model takes the task of inter-networking and divides that up into what is referred to as a vertical stack that consists of the following 7 layers.
