# Who Developed the OSI Model?
The International Standards Organization (ISO) developed the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. 
It divides network communication into seven layers. In this model, layers 1-4 are considered the lower layers, and mostly concern themselves with moving data around. Layers 5-7, called the the upper layers, contain application-level data. Networks operate on one basic principle: "pass it on." Each layer takes care of a very specific job, and then passes the data onto the next layer.
