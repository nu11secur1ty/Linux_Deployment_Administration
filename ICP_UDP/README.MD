# TCP

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is the most commonly used protocol on the Internet.

When you load a web page, your computer sends TCP packets to the web server’s address, asking it to send the web page to you. The web server responds by sending a stream of TCP packets, which your web browser stitches together to form the web page and display it to you. When you click a link, sign in, post a comment, or do anything else, your web browser sends TCP packets to the server and the server sends TCP packets back. TCP is not just one way communication — the remote system sends packets back to acknowledge it is received your packets.

TCP guarantees the recipient will receive the packets in order by numbering them. The recipient sends messages back to the sender saying it received the messages. If the sender does not get a correct response, it will resend the packets to ensure the recipient received them. Packets are also checked for errors. TCP is all about this reliability — packets sent with TCP are tracked so no data is lost or corrupted in transit. This is why file downloads do not become corrupted even if there are network hiccups. Of course, if the recipient is completely offline, your computer will give up and you will see an error message saying it can not communicate with the remote host.
