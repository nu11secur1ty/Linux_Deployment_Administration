# Convert HEX string into character string

Now, its time to do the reverse task. You'll be given a Hex string, and you'll need to convert it into character string. The idea will be similar as last one. Just need to pick-up two hex digit each time, and convert them into character code. Below is the code. This time using hex() function I have converted the hex code into integer number, and then using chr() function, I have converted the ascii number into it's character code.
